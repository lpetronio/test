        <h2>Polygenic Score Application</h2>
        <p>Polygenic scores may be useful tools to assess risk for many important health outcomes, including
            substance use disorders and mental health conditions, all of which are influenced by our genes.
            <br><br>
            Alcohol use disorder is diagnosed when an individual has trouble stopping or controlling their
            alcohol use despite it causing serious problems at home, at work, or to their health. More than 107
            million people around the world have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive alcohol use can cause liver
            disease, digestive problems, heart problems, neurological complications, and increased risk of
            cancer. Nearly 100,000 people die as a result of alcohol problems every year in the United States.

            <h2>DNA is not destiny &mdash; additional factors influence your risk</h2>
            <p>Both genes and environments influence a person’s risk of developing an alcohol use disorder.
                <br><br>
                A polygenic score is based only on the genetic code you were born with, and reflects how many genetic
                variants you carry that increase risk and decrease risk. Researchers are still in the process of finding
                all the genes that influence alcohol use disorder. So far, they have only identified some of the
                specific genetic variants that contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder. Right now
                polygenic risk scores only account for up to 5% of the total things that can contribute to the
                development of alcohol problems. How accurately they predict outcomes can also vary across people with
                different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Minorities tend to be underrepresented in genetic research, so
                polygenic risk scores may not be as accurate for people with non-European ancestral backgrounds.
                <br><br>
                Even though you can’t change your genetics, there are ways to reduce your risk of developing an alcohol
                use disorder.
